3. Pick any character you wanna reset
> [!TIP]
> If you wanna reset all save files, you'll need to reset each indiviality. if you are playing an older version of there is an already an option to reset it all. but no option to select a specific file. so **becareful**!

#### dammit chal you fucking jumpscared me, not cool :(


# will you clean up the shitty code

maybe not. as there is a remake coming, I don't see a reason to clean up the fucking code.


# I'm a developer and if you can add a console to the remake, that'll be cool.

it is planned.

# will the remake be in unity?
no.

# what about scratch?
what the actual fuck, no.

# unreal engine?
no. it would make the game 10x more laggy. and broken.
